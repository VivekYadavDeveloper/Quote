# Quotes Vaults

Hi, I'm Creation Team, I'm a Flutter And Native(Jetpack Compose) Developer 🚀 from Mau (Uttar
Pradesh) India.

Quotes Vaults is a mobile application that can help you to find the best quotes from the best people
in the world. This app is built with Flutter, Supabase and Riverpod State Management. This app is
still under development, so there are many features that are not yet available. I will continue to
develop this application to be better in the future. If you want to contribute to this application,
you can fork this repository and make a pull request. I will be very happy to accept your
contribution. Thank you very much for your contribution.
